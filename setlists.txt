The former leader of Chinese rock band Ado, Jian's solo music is continually embraced by new generations: his albums having sold more than 10 million copies in Asia. The Wall Street Journal said, "Cui Jian continues to be an inspiration for China's disenchanted youth." However, Jian's prime inspiration comes not from politics, but from personal issues. He said, "I talk about serious things in my heart and people's lives, including, of course, love. But, mostly it's about Chinese culture, the modern culture. They're not political songs. It's just the truth, the modern truth. I talk about our life in China." SET LIST "Fake Monk

Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK Cuando Te Veo" NENNY With warm maroon box braids nearly sweeping the floor and glitter adorning her eyes, NENNY's presence demands full attention before she even opens her mouth. Dressed in a flowy, all-white outfit accented with a pastel checker pattern and surrounded by a matching four-piece band, the 18-year-old Portuguese singer-songwriter and rapper appears otherworldly, almost heavenly, as she harmonizes with her backing electric guitar and jumps across the room, dancing with her entire body. NENNY first appeared on heads' radar in 2019 with her single "Sushi." She's continued to impress with several more singles and the release of her debut project, 2020's Aura. SET LIST "Bússola

Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK Tequila" Luedji Luna "I feel that we are living in a crazy moment in a crazy time and music has been a safe place for me — the only safe place for me," Luedji Luna says in a low, alluring voice as she explains the purpose of her latest album, Bom Mesmo É Estar Debaixo D'Água. The album, much like the Brazillian singer-songwriters's Tiny Desk performance, is a respite from these times. Elements of jazz and blues are infused with African rhythms as Luna uses music to express her ongoing struggles for autonomy as a Black woman. She performs from her coastal hometown of Bahia in the city of Salvador, Brazil, where African culture flows in abundance. Luna is a powerhouse, entrancing and elegant, soulful and spiritual, as she uses her platform to discuss individual and systemic forms of anti-Blackness. SET LIST “Lençois
Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK Erro
Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK Chororô" Calma Carmona From her hometown of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Calma Carmona delivers a bewitching Tiny Desk performance. Her voice rarely rises above a whisper as she sings over impassioned Afrobeats during her three-song set — but when it does, it's a gritty, intimidating growl. Carmona got her start in 2013 when the Latin soul singer-songwriter released her first EP and opened for Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in Puerto Rico. SET LIST "When I Was Your Girl

Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST Little Satchel" ROKIA TRAORÉ Rokia Traoré performed at globalFEST in 2005, the music festival's second year, and it's a thrill to present her meditative performance as part of Tiny Desk meets globalFEST. Her work is rooted in the Malian musical tradition, but defies the confines of a single culture. Born in Mali to a diplomat father, Traoré had a nomadic upbringing that exposed her to a wide variety of international musical influences. She joins us from Blues Faso, a theater inside her Foundation Passerelle in Mali, which she created to support emerging, interdisciplinary artists, from music and the performing arts to visual arts and photography.

Native and African-American singer-songwriter Martha Redbone is known for her mix of folk, blues and gospel from her childhood in Harlan County, Ky., which she infuses with the eclectic grit of pre-gentrified Brooklyn. Inheriting the powerful vocal range of her gospel-singing African-American father and the resilient spirit of her mother’s Cherokee, Shawnee and Choctaw culture, Redbone broadens the boundaries of American Roots music.

Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST It's A Shame" LABESS When we look at global arts, it's amazing to see how many traditions and nations can come together to make music together. Nowhere is that clearer than the music of Labess, an Algerian and Canadian band that is performing and recording their set from France and Colombia, proving that music has no boundaries even in times of isolation. "Labess" means "everything is fine" in Arabic, and their flamenco and Gypsy jazz-influenced North African chaabi (folk) music brings that message to life. SET LIST "Yal Maknin

Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST La Vida Es Un Carnaval" SOFIA REI Recording from her apartment in Brooklyn, award-winning vocalist and songwriter Sofia Rei provides a concert that blends Argentinian and other South American folk traditions with experimental pop and electronic music. This mix of tradition and modernity is even present in her setting, which blends traditional iconography with robotic 'saints' and exuberantly grown plants with sound boards and looping pedals. SET LIST "Un Mismo Cielo" (The Same Sky) "Negro Sobre Blanco" (Black On White) "Escarabajo Digital" (Digital Beetle) DAKHABRAKHA Recorded from Ukraine, DakhaBrakha returns both to globalFEST and Tiny Desk. Their first globalFEST performance was in 2014, and their time with Tiny Desk in 2015 remains a favorite. We've had them in our spaces, so it's a real treat to see them in theirs, the Dakh Theater in Kyiv, where the band formed and where they've crafted their amazing catalogue of songs. Coming together, their performance maintains the energy and joy that define their music, bouncing off each other musically and emotionally. SET LIST "Komora
